# XYZreader 
This is the P5 project from Udacity android nanodegree course. It is a mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos. 
The goal of the project was to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the 
UI and make it conform to Material Design.

### UI
* Material design theme
* Scrolling toolbar with logo
* Coordinator layout
* Swipe to refresh
* Shared transition with transition delay and custom SharedElementCallback(overriding onMapSharedElements()) 
for correct back transition when ViewPager elements swiped (great thanks to https://github.com/alexjlockwood/activity-transitions) 
* Phones and tablets support
